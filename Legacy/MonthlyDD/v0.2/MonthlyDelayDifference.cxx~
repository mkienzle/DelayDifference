//           3. a vector of targeted effort
//           4. a vector of non-targeted effort 
//           5. a vector of 11 parameters estimated by MINUIT, in order: targeted catchability; non-targeted catchability; sigma; biomass at step 1 and 2; von mises mean and variance, recruitment in year 1..4)
