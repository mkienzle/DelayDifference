v0.1: estimates 7 parameters (Targeted catchability, Nontargeted catchability, sigma, Biomass1, Biomass2, vm_mean, vm_sigma) + 1 recruitment per year. Natural mortality, rho, etc.. were fixed in FixPar.h. This model was used for Environmental and fishing effects on the dynamics of brown tiger prawn (Penaeus esculentus) in Moreton Bay (Australia),Fisheries Research, Volume 155, July 2014, Pages 138-148

v0.2: reads fixed natural mortality, rho, etc... from a local file allowing to change these parameters after the delay difference model was compiled.



# Ideas for improvement
- the WeeklyDelayDifference.cxx returns the calculation of biomass at 1 particular time steps which is very inefficient: it would be better if it returned a vector of double or modified  a vector of biomass passed as an argument to the function



This C++ implementation of the delay difference model for fish stock assessment purposes was tested on simulated dataset. The results of such simulation can be found in ~/mystuff/Work/DEEDI/Moreton Bay Prawn Trawl fishery/Analysis/Scripts/DelayDifferenceModel/1989-2010/Weekly/Test the code
